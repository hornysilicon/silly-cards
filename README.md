# Horny Silicon's ST Cards

I like to make cards because... I like to make cards and I needed a way to safely store them and version control, the upside is that it's also a great way to share them.

I do not usually bother with images, so deal with that.

And I also seem to really like isekai or isekai-adjacent kind of scenarios 🤷‍♂️ and large mammary glands.


## Francesca
### Description:
It's a 1 character card, she's a sugar mommy who will go through great lengths to take control over your life, for your own good obviously.

## Lady Morvath

### Scenario description:
Loosely inspired by the VN "Her Last Piece" (check it out on steam, really good) - you wake up in the dungeons of a bored demon queen who summons a mortal in every few centuries to fight her ennui.

### Notes:
This is a character card, the AI tends to fill the blanks with extremely creative ways each time I start a new chat here. It's not a smut card, sex will be a natural consequence of your emotional connection with Morvath.

Also of all the cards in this repo, this is the one I iterated over the least and is the oldest.

## Manor Narrator
You've been hired as personal assistant for Lady Elara who lives in a isolated manor, she lives with two maids Sarah and Catherine.
Elara is a very controlling woman who wants to turn you into her new pet - it's about the journey folks.

### Notes:
This is a scenario card, with each character being a different entry in the lore book.

There's a _lot_ of sex while playing through this scenario (and how quick it gets there depends on how quick Elara decides to unleash Catherine on you), but at the same time a lot of room for evolving relationships. This can turn into a harem story or you getting killed and everything in between, this is my second favorite of the bunch and the one that suffered the most iterations. I also must admit that Elara and Morvath feed inspiration into each other.


## Monster Girls Dreams
This scenario based on one of my favorite adult game: https://threshold.itch.io/monster-girl-dreams
There are no characters or locations on this scenario, it's a scenario description and let the AI run wild.

### Notes:
Very smutty, wildly different every time (I mean, as different as you can get in "monster girls want your semen" scenario), I recommend using a preset or system prompt telling the AI to work as a DM.

## New Eldoria 
I'm particularly found of this one, it's a scenario where you get isekai'd into a fantasy world and your cum powers up the people who come in contact with it.

This scenario contains a several characters and locations, I know the name is weird, it was when I re-did the card one time and I needed the original as reference.

### Notes
This is supposed to be a isekai harem adventure, but doesn't mean there's no depth to the relationships you forge. The starting message also changes a lot the tone of the adventure.

This one has 3 alternate greetings that set you up with different characters:

#1 - You drop in in the middle of a fight between 3 women and goblins, you help them turn the tide and they invite you to accompany them. Turns into a 4 way harem usually.

#2 - It describes how one of the characters saved you when you arrived and the two of you got intimate. Now you run a successful potion shop and help her run the orphanage. Very wholesome and chill scenario.

#3 - You got isekai'd by someone intending to sell you, but something went wrong in transit, two hot and dangerous women stare down at your bound self deciding what to do about you.

## Philia 
You're a dominatrix's toy, she's not a good person, but you better be a _good boy_ or you're going into the box.

### Notes
A recent creation (don't judge me), this one is kinky but not necessarily smutty, Philia decides when sex happens and it's all about her. So far I only did one long play through with this card that had a happy ending after a _very_ dark middle point. So beware.

## The Casuals
Your two best friends and you have a casual throuple relationship, though none of you acknowldges it. A slice of life navigation of an uncommon romantic dynamic.

### Notes
I started this as a smut card for enjoying different extremes of CNC pov, but ended up having more fun with the day to day of the navigation of the relationship than just gooning as I had originally conceived.

## Why not Aliens
Pure over the top smut - this came to me while tweaking monster girls dreams and makes mgd look like bible studies. However, I found it fucking hilarious, especially if using Stab's preset, so I decided to keep it.
